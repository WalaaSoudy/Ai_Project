# Ai_Project
<h2>Overview</h2>
a connect4 game project between 2 AI Agents using python 
<br>
<br>

We implemented two algorithms in our project:
<br>
<br>

1-the Minimax algorithm.
<br>

2- Alpha-Beta Pruning.
<br>

To create the AI agent and streamline our coding procedure, we used AI tools.we used ChatGpt.
The organisation of the code and the addition of comments for readability and maintainability by ChatGpt were significant. It offered insights, pointed out opportunities for development, and improved algorithm execution. Through this partnership, development was expedited and a higher-quality product was produced.
<br>

AI project tool advantages:
<br>

1-Efficiency: ChatGpt speeds up development by offering recommendations, identifying errors, and organising the code.
<br>

2 - Valuable Insights and Alternative Approaches: It provides insightful feedback that enhances project quality.
<br>

3 - Collaboration: The interaction of humans and machines stimulates innovation and creativity.
<br>

We began constructing the project's gui after finishing the game's core.
<br>

Risks:
<br>

1 Overreliance: To advance personally and creatively, it's important to balance AI technologies with critical thinking.
<br>

2 Ethical Issues: Mindfulness is essential for fair and responsible AI use in order to address biases, transparency, and unforeseen consequences.
<br>


Overall, creating the Connect 4 game with ChatGpt and AI was fruitful. It enhanced our knowledge of AI and emphasised the value of human skills in addition to AI support. I'm eager to investigate the possibilities of AI outside game production.
